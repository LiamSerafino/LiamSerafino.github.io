                <h2>First, Lets begin with the Renegade series</h2>
		<p>The Renegade comes in 6 different packages all fulfilling different wants and needs. <h3>With the first being the Renegade X-RS</h3></p>

		<p><h3>Package Highlights</h3>
    
        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">MORE POWER YOU CAN FEEL</h4>
        <p>The most powerful 2-stroke engine in the industry. It pumps out 10 more horsepower (165 hp) than its predecessor, but its responsiveness is what really shines. With the new pDrive primary clutch it’s 30% quicker responding than the 800R E-TEC giving you the instant control you demand.
        Observed HP measured on internal dyno test in optimal conditions for 2-stroke engines.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">POWER, MEET SOPHISTICATION</h4>
        <p>The 150-horsepower* Rotax 900 ACE Turbo delivers instant acceleration at the punch of the throttle. With a Rotax-built turbocharger specifically designed for the 900 ACE engine, riders get the technology they love with the reliable, powerful performance they demand in one advanced engine package. Like the base 900 ACE, this turbocharged engine also includes drive-by-wire intelligent Throttle Control (iTC) with three driving modes (Sport, Standard, ECO) and finger throttle.
        *Observed HP metric based on internal dyno test in optimal conditions.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">QUICK, EFFICIENT, EASY</h4>
        <p>A major factor in the quickness of REV sleds is the new pDrive clutch. Fast and friction-free dual rollers transfer torque in place of traditional sliding buttons on this 100% clutch. The oversize rollers with needle bearings, wide flyweights and shaft-on-shaft design emphasize smooth operation and long life. Ultra-responsive shifting, impressive RPM consistency and 2.8 lb./ 1.3 kg lighter than the TRA VII.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</h4>
        <p>The 4th generation of the REV platform is designed around aggressive trail riders with a narrow, compact package giving the rider more freedom to move and influence the sled. More centralized masses (especially side-to-side), light weight and industry-leading suspensions make the vehicle ultra responsive.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">A NEW VIEW</h4>
        <p>All-digital LCD gauge with customizable display with flatter viewing angle provides riders their preferred info that’s easy to see sitting or standing.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">CAPABILITY, CONTROL AND COMFORT</h4>
        <p>Provides more capability, more comfort and more adjustability. Separate spring and shock dynamics combine with the most rising-rate/progressive motion ratio in the industry to give the rMotion suspension a supple ride in small bumps with added capability in large ones. And there’s no need to be a suspension guru to enjoy the ride – with its broad sweet spot, you can set it up once and it will perform impressively in nearly every condition.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">RACE READY</h4>
        <p>Designed for the toughest terrain racing, the X-RS package includes special features. The steering post is more forward (850 E-TEC only) for the most aggressive cornering and stand-up riding position. And the running boards are reinforced for tough landings.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">PRO-LEVEL SHOCKS</h4>
        <p>Designed to the same high standards as the MXZx 600RS race sled - so you know they're extremely capable and durable for control in the toughest conditions. Remote reservoir design for performance and they are rebuildable/revalvable. Easy Adjust compression damping knob requires no tools; rebound adjustments are standard on front shocks also.</p>

        <h4 style="color:green;margin-left:24px;">ROOM TO ROAM</h4>
        <p>Designed for aggressive stand-up riding, they are flatter for most of their length, wider and strong. Thicker aluminum sheet (3 mm vs. 1.8 mm), plus front and rear reinforcements to withstand tough landings.</p>
