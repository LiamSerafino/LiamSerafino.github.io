        <h2>Now, Lets look at the Freeride Series</h2>
		<p>The Freeride comes in 3 different packages all fulfilling different wants and needs. <h3>With the first being the Freeride 146</h3></p>

		<p><h3>Package Highlights</h3>
    
        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">MORE POWER YOU CAN FEEL</h4>
        <p>The most powerful 2-stroke engine in the industry. It pumps out 10 more horsepower (165 hp) than its predecessor, but its responsiveness is what really shines. With the new pDrive primary clutch it’s 30% quicker responding than the 800R E-TEC giving you the instant control you demand.
        Observed HP measured on internal dyno test in optimal conditions for 2-stroke engines.</p>

        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">EASIEST STARTING</h4>
        <p>Push-button starting with almost no added weight. After an initial pull-start, the engine charges an ultracapacitor. Pushing the handlebar SHOT button for subsequent starts uses energy stored in the ultracapacitor to turn the magneto into an electric motor that rotates the flywheel, and with E-TEC technology, starts the engine. Eliminates nearly 20 lb. (9 kg) compared to conventional electric start. SHOT starting is only possible with Ski-Doo-exclusive E-TEC technology.</p>

        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">QUICK, EFFICIENT, EASY</h4>
        <p>A major factor in the quickness of REV sleds is the new pDrive clutch. Fast and friction-free dual rollers transfer torque in place of traditional sliding buttons on this 100% clutch. The oversize rollers with needle bearings, wide flyweights and shaft-on-shaft design emphasize smooth operation and long life. Ultra-responsive shifting, impressive RPM consistency and 2.8 lb./ 1.3 kg lighter than the TRA VII.</p>

        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">KEEPING IT COOL</h4>
        <p>Side panel venting improves airflow to drive components for cooler operations and optimal performance.</p>

        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</h4>
        <p>Key to the Summit’s agility is the extreme mass centralization of the 4th generation REV platform. The trademark pyramidal frame, new die-cast aluminum front suspension module and new heat exchanger design ensure it’s strong, yet lightweight.</p>
        
        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">PRO-LEVEL SHOCKS</h4>
        <p>Designed to the same high standards as the MXZx 600RS race sled - so you know they're extremely capable and durable for control in the toughest conditions. Remote reservoir design for performance and they are rebuildable/revalvable. Easy Adjust compression damping knob requires no tools; rebound adjustments are standard on front shocks also.</p>
        
        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">ROOM TO ROAM</h4>
        <p>Designed for aggressive stand-up riding, they are flatter for most of their length, wider and strong. Thicker aluminum sheet (3 mm vs. 1.8 mm), plus front and rear reinforcements to withstand tough landings.</p>

        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">PRECISE ON-TRAIL, AGILE OFF-TRAIL</h4>
        <p>Strikes the best balance between trail and mountain sled geometry and width to deliver great trail precision and off trail agility. State-of-the-art unequal length A-arm front suspension for the 50/50 rider. Adjustable ski stance for the ideal ride.</p>

        <h4 style="color:blue;margin-left:24px;">CARVES WITH YOU</h4>
        <p>The tMotion flexes laterally, reducing the effort to initiate a roll, due to a ball joint at the center hinge between the rear arm and drop link and split flat-tube front arms. Very progressive motion ratio makes the ride on trails even more comfortable.</p>
