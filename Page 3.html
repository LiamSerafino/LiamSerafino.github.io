		<p><h3>Package Highlights</h3>
    
        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">MORE POWER YOU CAN FEEL</h4>
        <p>The most powerful 2-stroke engine in the industry. It pumps out 10 more horsepower (165 hp) than its predecessor, but its responsiveness is what really shines. With the new pDrive primary clutch it’s 30% quicker responding than the 800R E-TEC giving you the instant control you demand.
        Observed HP measured on internal dyno test in optimal conditions for 2-stroke engines.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">EASIEST STARTING</h4>
        <p>Push-button starting with almost no added weight. After an initial pull-start, the engine charges an ultracapacitor. Pushing the handlebar SHOT button for subsequent starts uses energy stored in the ultracapacitor to turn the magneto into an electric motor that rotates the flywheel, and with E-TEC technology, starts the engine. Eliminates nearly 20 lb. (9 kg) compared to conventional electric start. SHOT starting is only possible with Ski-Doo-exclusive E-TEC technology.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">SMOOTH RIDE</h4>
        <p>Kashima coating delivers silky smooth shock piston movement for consistent cushioning through every bump - big and small. Plus, adds durability for worry-free performance on every ride.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">DEEP SNOW DESIGN</h4>
        <p>Purpose-built for a better deep-snow experience with lower seat height, shorter riser, smaller diameter handlebars and low handlebar strap for the ultimate advantage in deep snow.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">A MORE CONFIDENT RIDE</h4>
        <p>Revised ski spindle and ski stopper for more predictable handling and a confidence-inspiring ride on steep sidehills and rough terrain.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">NEXT GENERATION OF A LEGEND</h4>
        <p>Key to the Summit’s agility is the extreme mass centralization of the 4th generation REV platform. The trademark pyramidal frame, new die-cast aluminum front suspension module and new heat exchanger design ensure it’s strong, yet lightweight.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">DIAL YOUR RIDE</h4>
        <p>Quickly and easily change limiter strap length for desired ski lift without crawling under the sled.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">EYE-CATCHING BODY ARMOR</h4>
        <p>Striking glossy finish with high-end protective panel wrap to resist scratches and blemishes keeps your sled looking showroom ready.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">KEEPING IT COOL</h4>
        <p>Side panel venting improves airflow to drive components for cooler operations and optimal performance.</p>

        <h4 style="color:red;margin-left:24px;">CAPABILITY, CONTROL, AND COMFORT</h4>
        <p>Rigid full-length extruded aluminum grid-style design with wide openings for exceptional snow evacuation and superior grip. Flat foot positioning for comfort and control, plus a 1 lb. weight reduction. (X packages only</p>
